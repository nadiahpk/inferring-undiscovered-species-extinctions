## Overview

This repository stores data and code (mostly Python3, with some interface to R) that was used to infer the number of vascular plant species that went extinct in Singapore since colonialisation, including those that went extinct before they could be discovered, using the SEUX model (Chisholm et al. 2016).

**Abstract**

Extinction is a key issue in the assessment of global biodiversity.  However, many extinction-rate measures do not account for species that went extinct before they could be discovered.  The highly developed island city-state of Singapore has one of the best-documented tropical floras in the world. This allowed us to estimate the total rate of local floristic extinctions in Singapore since 1822 after accounting for sampling effort and cryptoextinctions by collating herbaria records.  Our database comprised 34224 specimens from 2076 native species, of which 464 species (22%) were considered nationally extinct.  We assumed that undiscovered species had the same annual per-species extinction rates as discovered species and that no undiscovered species remained extant.  With classical and Bayesian algorithms, we estimated that, respectively, 304 (95% CI 213-414) and 412 (95% credible interval 313-534) additional species went extinct before they could be discovered; thus, corresponding total extinction rate estimates were 32% and 35% (range 30â€“38%).  We detected violations of our two assumptions that could cause our extinction estimates, particularly the absolute numbers, to be biased downward.  Thus, our estimates should be treated as lower bounds.  Our results illustrate the possible magnitudes of plant extirpations that can be expected in the tropics as development continues.

## About the repository

The diagram below gives an overview of the directory structure, and highlights important data and results files. The Singapore plants database can be found in `merged.csv`, and the input to the model in `first last detns final.csv`. The method and results for classical and Bayesian inference can be found in the `classical` and `mcmc` directories, respectively.

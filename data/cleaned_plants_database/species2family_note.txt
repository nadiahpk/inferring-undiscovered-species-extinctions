Family names in the plants database (merged.csv) have been left as they were received from the database source.
However, for the family-level analyses, we addressed synonyms and standardised the family names.

* Synonyms include (standardised to name on right):
    Compositae = Asteraceae
    Gramineae = Poaceae
    Leguminosae = Fabaceae
    Guttiferae = Clusiaceae

* All species of the Calophyllum genus were put into Calophyllaceae (from Clusiaceae/Guttiferae)

* Subfamilies were only indicated for a few, so all subfamilies were reduced to family level, including:
    Apocynaceae-asc
    Malvaceae-byt
    Mavaceae-dom
    Leguminosae-pap
